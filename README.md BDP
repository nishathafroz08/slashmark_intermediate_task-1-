# Blood Donation Prediction using Machine Learning  

## Project Overview  
This project predicts whether a person will donate blood based on their past donation history. It uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)** to analyze past donations and predict future ones.  

## Dataset Information  
The dataset used in this project comes from the **Blood Transfusion Service Center (Hsin-Chu City, Taiwan)** and contains **748 donor records**. The key features include:  

- **Recency (months):** Months since the last blood donation.  
- **Frequency (times):** Total number of donations made.  
- **Monetary (c.c. blood):** Total blood donated (in c.c.).  
- **Time (months):** Time since the first donation.  
- **Target Variable:** Whether the donor donated blood in **March 2007** (`1 = Yes`, `0 = No`).  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy**  
- **Scikit-learn (Random Forest)**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**
